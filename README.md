A partial reproduction of
Noise Against Noise: Stochastic Label Noise Helps Combat Inherent Label Noise (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=80FMcTSZ6J0)


This reposity contains our notebook that can be run in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook (together with a GPU) for training on 4 versions of noise of CIFAR-10.
Contained as well is the numpy array containing the softmax outputs for 150 epochs of training to create the instance dependent noisy dataset.
